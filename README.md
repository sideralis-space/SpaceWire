# What is SpaceWire?
**SpaceWire** and **SpaceFibre** (repo coming later) are communication protocols specifically designed for spaceflight applications. They enable high-speed data transfer and efficient communication between spacecraft components, such as sensors, processing units, and memory devices.

**SpaceWire**: A digital network protocol for high-speed links and networks on board spacecraft. It supports data rates from 2 to 200 Mbit/s and offers a reliable, bi-directional, full-duplex communication channel.

**SpaceFibre**: An extension of SpaceWire, offering higher data rates (up to 5.44 Gbit/s), improved quality of service, and fault tolerance. It is particularly suited for applications requiring higher bandwidth and robustness.

## Why This Project?

The *Inunus* *SpaceWire-Fibre Open Source Project* is driven by the vision of accelerating innovation, reducing costs, and fostering collaboration in space communication technologies. By sharing knowledge and resources, we aim to standardize and simplify the implementation of these technologies in various space missions.

## Objectives

 1. Innovation: Encourage collaborative development and innovation in spacecraft communication technologies. 
 2. Education: Serve as a learning platform for students and professionals in space technology.
 3. Cost-Efficiency: Reduce the cost of implementing SpaceWire and SpaceFibre in space missions.
 4. Standardization: Promote standardization and compatibility in spacecraft communication systems.
